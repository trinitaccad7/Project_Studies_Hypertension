Blood pressure (BP) values were obtained after the participant was seated for quietly for 10 minutes; a mean of 3 replicate measurements was taken at least 1 minute apart. However, if the 3 consecutive seated BP readings were not within 8 mm Hg of each other, an additional 2 BP readings were obtained (total = 5) and incorporated into the calculated mean. BP was measured in both arms. If the BP was higher in one arm than the other, then this arm was used; if no difference, the participant's dominant arm was used for all future BP measurements. Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to the start date and time of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. Participants refrained from ingestion of caffeine, alcohol, or nicotine at least 10 hours prior to their visit and having their BP measured., Baseline to Week 12|Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) for 12 Week Double-Blind Treatment Period - Randomized Participants, Adjusted mean change in glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c) from baseline at Week 12 was calculated. HbA1c was measured as percent of hemoglobin by a central laboratory. Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to the start date and time of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. HbA1c values were obtained at enrollment and lead-in (Day -28) periods, and at Day 1, Weeks 4, 8, and 12, in the double-blind period., Baseline to Week 12","Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in 24-hour Ambulatory Systolic Blood Pressure at Week 12 Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF), Ambulatory 24 hour (hr) blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was performed at baseline, which was during the lead-in period (between Day -7 and Day -1 prior to randomization) and 1 week prior to the Week 12 visit/end of treatment visit. If no Week 12 measurement was available, the last available earlier post-baseline measurement was used (LOCF) for analysis. Initiation of the 24-hr ABPM began between 6am and 11am to ensure trough BP measurements were obtained.The ABPM units were calibrated, and used per the manufacturer's and central ABPM vendor instructions. BP was measured in mmHg. Participants had to have a mean 24-hour ABPM â‰¥ 130/80 mmHg prior to randomization. All medication was withheld on the morning of the study visit and brought to the visit site by the participant. Once the ABPM cuff was in place, all morning medication was taken while at the site., Baseline, Week 12|Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Seated Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) for 12 Week Double-Blind Treatment Period - Randomized Participants, Diastolic BP was measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) on Day -1, Day 1, Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 of the Double Blind Period. Diastolic BP values were obtained after the participant was seated for quietly for 10 minutes; a mean of 3 replicate measurements was taken at least 1 minute apart. However, if the 3 consecutive seated BP readings were not within 8 mm Hg of each other, an additional 2 BP readings were obtained (total = 5) and incorporated into the calculated mean.

Serum uric acid was measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) by a central laboratory. Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to the start date and time of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. Serum uric acid measurements were obtained at qualification and lead-in (Day -28) periods, and at Day 1, Weeks 4, 8, and 12, in the double-blind period but only the change from baseline at Week 12 was considered a secondary endpoint and is presented., Baseline, Week 12|Number of Participants With Deaths,Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Adverse Events (AEs), Hypoglycemia Events, Discontinuation Due to AEs, SAEs and Hypoglycemia, During the 12 Week Double Blind Period, Including Data After Rescue, Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), version 15.1 AE=any new unfavorable symptom, sign, or disease or worsening of a preexisting condition that may not have a causal relationship with treatment.
