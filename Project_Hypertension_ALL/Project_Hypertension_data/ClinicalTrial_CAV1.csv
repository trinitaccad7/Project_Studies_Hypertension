We will recruit hypertensive subjects who will be classified into two groups according to genotype status at rs926198 of CAV-1. Vascular function status will be determined using four markers: renal blood flow (primary endpoint), brachial artery reactivity, aortic compliance, and blood pressure levels.

We will assess these endpoints before and after two provocations: low vs. high salt intake and AngII infusion., 5 years",,,Brigham and Women's Hospital,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)|National Institutes of Health (NIH)","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE1,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: OTHER,2010P002187|1R01HL104032-01,
