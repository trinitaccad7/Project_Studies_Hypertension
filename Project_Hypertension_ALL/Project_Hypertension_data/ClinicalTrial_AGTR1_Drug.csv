Glucose was measured immediately on a YSI glucose analyzer and insulin was measured via ELISA colormetric kits once all study samples were collected. To analyze changes in insulin sensitivity, the MINMOD software was used. The MINMOD software uses Bergman's minimal model to determine insulin sensitivity during an intravenous glucose tolerance test. Both glucose and insulin values were inserted at each timepoint collected (33 in total over the 3-hour protocol) and the software was run to generate the insulin sensitivity value at baseline and post-test. This information was then used to calculate the change of insulin sensitivity from baseline to post-testing after each 8-week intervention., Baseline testing to post-testing after 8-week intervention",,"Collagen Gene Expression in Skeletal Muscle (Change Over Time), RNA extraction and quantification were determined using an RNeasy Mini Fibrous Kit and DNase I treatment (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) in accordance to the manufacturer's directions for mRNA extraction.
