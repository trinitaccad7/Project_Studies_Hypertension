However, the capacity of patients to function is determined not only by what they can do when they exert themselves to the fullest, but also by how they feel when they are carrying out their usual activities of daily living.

The last observation carried forward method was used to impute missing values., Baseline and Week 24|Number of Participants With a Change From Baseline in Their World Health Organization (WHO) Functional Classification (FC) at Weeks 12 and 24, The WHO FC was determined by the investigator as follows: Class I- Participants with pulmonary hypertension (PH) but without resulting limitation of physical activity, II- Participants with PH resulting in slight limitation of physical activity, III- Participants with PH resulting in marked limitation of physical activity, IV- Participants with PH with inability to carry out any physical activity without symptoms. Changes from Baseline in functional class were summarized at Weeks 12 and 24. The number of participants improving by 2 classes, improving by 1 class, not changing, worsening by 1 class or worsening by 2 classes from Baseline at Weeks 12 and 24 were evaluated. The Baseline value was the last non-missing assessment value before treatment.

The BDI indicates the degree of exertion, breathlessness, fatigue, or difficulty breathing after completion of the 6MWT.

The geometric mean ratio was calculated as the ratio between the Week 24 value and the Baseline value (based on the log-transformed data) and presented as percent change = 100 \* (geometric mean ratio - 1). The Baseline value is the last value prior to administration of study drug; this may be prior to or on the day of study drug initiation. No imputation was performed for missing data.

Clinical worsening events included: death, hospitalization for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and disease progression. Participants without an event of clinical worsening prior to or at the Week 24 visit who did not have a 6MWD value or a WHO functional class value at Week 24 were excluded from the analysis., Baseline and Week 24|Change From Baseline in the 6 Minute Walk Distance Test at Week 24, The 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) test measures the distance that a participant can walk in a period of 6 minutes. Change from Baseline was calculated as the Week 24 value minus the Baseline value. The analysis was performed based on last observation carried forward data, except in the case of an adjudicated clinical failure event of death or hospitalization preceding the missing data observation. In this case, the missing observation was assigned the worst-rank score relative to those actually observed and was assigned a rank reflecting the relative order of the actual event times. Baseline 6MWD comprised of an average of the last two consecutive measurements prior to randomization that varied by no greater than 10%. If only one measurement was available, that measurement was used. If no two consecutive measures vary by no greater than 10% then Baseline was based on the last two consecutive measures for a participant., Baseline and Week 24|Change From Baseline in the World Health Organization Functional Class at Week 24, The WHO Functional Class (FC) indicates the severity of PAH and is an adaptation of the New York Heart Association classification. It was assessed by the investigator. There are four grades for WHO FC based on severity of symptoms (Class I = none, Class IV = most severe). Baseline WHO FC is the latest assessment prior to dosing (i.e., at Randomization or Screening). Change from Baseline at Week 24 was calculated as the Week 24 value minus the Baseline value. The analysis was performed based on the last observation carried forward data, except in the case of an adjudicated clinical failure event of death or hospitalization preceding the missing data observation. In this case, the missing observations was assigned the worst-rank score relative to those actually observed and was assigned rank reflecting the relative order of the actual event times., Baseline and Week 24|Change From Baseline in Borg Dyspnea Index at Week 24, Borg Dyspnea Index (BDI) indicates the degree of breathlessness after completion of the 6 minute walk test. The BDI was calculated by using the Borg category (C) ratio (R) CR10 scale which starts at 0 (nothing at all) and has no upper limit (extremely strong). Change from BL was calculated as the Week 24 values minus the BL value. The BDI scale was assessed by each participant. The BL BDI score is the average of the two BDI values obtained following the two 6MWD tests used in determining the BL 6MWD. A negative change from BL in the BDI score represented an improvement for the participant. The analysis was performed based on the last observation carried forward data, except in the case of an adjudicated clinical failure event of death or hospitalization preceding the missing data observation.

The clinical severity of PAH is classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) according to a system that grades PAH severity according to the functional status of the patient. The grades range from Functional Class (FC) I, where the patient's disease does not affect their day-to-day activities, to FC IV, where patients are severely functionally impaired, even at rest.

Once released from the heart in response to ventricle volume expansion or pressure overload, the N-terminal (NT) piece of 76 amino acids (NT-proBNP) is rapidly cleaved by the enzymes corin and furin to release the active 32-amino acid peptide (BNP).

The Week 24 value was defined as the last assessment at or prior to Week 24., Baseline to Week 24|Change From Baseline at Week 24 in Short Form (SF-36) Physical Functioning Scale, Quality of life was assessed using the SF-36 questionnaire, a self-administered multi-item survey that asks 36 questions to measure functional health and well-being from the participant's point of view and consists of eight health domains (Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional, and Mental Health) as well as 2 summary measures (Physical Health and Mental Health). Data presented are for 1 of the domains only: Physical Functioning. Scores can range from 0 to 100, with a higher score representing a higher level of functioning.

The Week 24 value was defined as the last assessment at or prior to Week 24., Baseline to Week 24|Change From Baseline in Echocardiographic Measures of Right Ventricular Function at Week 24: Right Ventricular Tei Index (RVTI), The Tei-index is defined as the sum of the isovolumic contraction and the isovolumic relaxation time divided by ejection time, and thus incorporates elements of both systolic and diastolic phases in the assessment of global ventricular function. An increased Tei-index results from ventricular dysfunction and provides prognostic information for a variety of myocardial conditions. The RVTI is a candidate to increase the non-invasive diagnosis of PAH because it reflects the right ventricular function, is easy to assess, and can be estimated in the same session as the echocardiographic PAP. The normal value of the RVTI is 0.28 +/- 0.04. An increased RVTI is associated with either left ventricular diastolic abnormalities or pulmonary hypertension. This score has no bounds.
