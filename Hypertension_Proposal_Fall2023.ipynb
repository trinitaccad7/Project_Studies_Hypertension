    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>The purpose of this project report was to obtain and compile data for the biomarkers associated with 'Hypertension'. The pipeline of this report started with data mining through pubmed literatures, then focused more in searching through the ClinVar, OMIM, and KEGG databases in identifying potential gene targets/biomarkers associated with the disease. After identifying all potential genes, the next phase (as shown in the flowchart above) was to search each individual gene in ClinicalTrials.gov in retrieving antihypertensive drugs information. With all of the gathered data in the analysis pipeline, the final task of populating a tab-delimited file with all required data entries was achieved.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>In addition, due to the lack of coding skills and computer science background, there were limitations and inefficiencies in fetching some data entries, which include retrieval of 'mutational remarks', 'drug_class', and 'system/pathway info' that instead of retrieving it by command line execution, the search was perfomed via web browsing the actual KEGG and OMIM databases. Table or tab-delimited entries result from the ClinicalTrials.gov had to be manually searched and downloaded via web browsing, which took many hours to execute. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>As a personal note, the final data output generated here in this project report was constructed and carried out in the best of my current experience, skills and abilities learned after 2 semesters in the Bioinformatics graduate program. The data results obtained in the analysis pipeline could be changed and/or enhanced to increase efficiency and expand data mining and database searching.</p>\n"
